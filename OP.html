        <li><h2>Why you should watch/read One Piece</h2></li>
        <li><p>One Piece is a story about a boy named Luffy who goes out to sea on an adventure to fulfil his dream to become the King Of The Pirates. In the story, the way to do so is to find the elusive and coveted treasure, the One Piece. While this plot may sound very simplistic and straight-forward, what makes the story of One Piece unique from other similar stories is the premise of adventure. <br><br> <img src="../img/Blog1_2.jpg" alt="Blog Pic"><br><br> The main goal of the main characters in the story does not change throughout the journey, but the One Piece world feels like it is an evolving world (much like our world) and through this story we can also learn many truths about our own world. There are many references made throughout the story to real world events, which makes this story even more immersing. </p></li>
