        <li><p>All of you who have tried to solve difficult problems in coding and failed will be able to relate when I say that I found it very difficult to solve problems using code just because I wouldn't understand half the errors I got, and I wouldn't know how to resolve the other errors that I eventually atleast was able to understand. But believe me when I say this, but it is a lot easier to solve a problem by actually delaying writing the code to the problem, and following these Five Steps of Procedure, that to understand the question and "start typing immediately". <br><br> <img src="../img/Recursive1_2.jpg" alt="Blog Pic"><br><br> The Five Steps of Procedure that need to be followed are as follows :- <br><br> 
        <li class="list">Find a Base Case for the simplest possible Input or Output.</li>
        <li class="list">Play around with examples for the Problem and Visualize how the solution to the problem would work.</li>
        <li class="list">Relate a harder, more complicated example to the simple examples we earlier played with.</li>
        <li class="list">Generalize a pattern that emerges due to all the examples.</li>
        <li class="list">Write code by combining the pattern that emerges with the base case.</li>
        <br><br>
        I found that using this method meant that I not only understood the problem and what it expects from me better, but also was able to reach a solution much faster than I usually would.
